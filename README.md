# Cluster-Analysis-KMeans-Heirarchical
Shopping Mall dataset analysis using KMeans &amp; Heirarchical clustering in python
Thesis: 
•	We have a shopping mall dataset which contains customer’s information such as their age, gender, annual income and their spending score.
•	This information is collected based on the subscription of membership card.
•	Note: spending score is assessed by shopping mall based on certain criteria like the number of times customer turns up in a week/month and their spending on a products, etc…
•	Spending score ranges from (1-100) this indicates the customers who spends more falls near to 100 and who spends less are eventually close to 1.
•	The shopping mall company has hired us as Data Scientist and need to understand pattern and to see what that gives us the output it’s completely cluster problem where we doesn’t know exactly what we looking for.
•	Let’s run both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering methods and see if we can find any insights so that it will improve shopping mall business.
